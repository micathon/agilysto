# Code of Conduct
* This code of conduct applies to both project contributors and end-users
* Treat other users with respect
* No bullying
* No hate speech: 
  * comparing any 2 sub-groups of people, in which both sub-groups belong to one of the following groups: 
    ethnic background, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, able/disabled, rich/poor, left-wing/right-wing; 
    in which those 2 sub-groups are considered unequal
* Example: 2 sub-groups of the religion group include Christians and Muslims, when comparing those 2 sub-groups, 
  if Christians are considered superior to Muslims, that's not kosher
* When comparing the following 2 pairs of sub-groups within able/disabled: mainstream (able) with either 
  intellectual disabilities or mental health-related disabilities, both comparisons are equal, full stop
* Some topics such as politics can be sensitive, so try not to be "in-your-face" for those topics
