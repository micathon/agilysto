# Contributing to Picrony
* Many thanks for your interest in being a Picrony contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions in early 2021
* If you wish to write detailed design specs or anything more ambitious, please contact me
* At this point I don't have much documentation for coders, just email me with your questions for now
# How to run Picrony
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`
* `$ java pcy dotop > out.txt`
* text files:
  * `dat/dotop.pcy`: sample Picrony source code
  * `bin/out.txt`: used for debugging and logging what my code is doing
  * both `dotop` and `out.txt` file names can be any valid Linux file name (or Windows/Mac)
# Roadmap

# Contact Me
* Please send me an email, ask me anything, any comments are always welcome
* Now that the readme, contributing, and code-of-conduct files are up on GitHub, I'm closer to accepting contributions when the time comes. Thanks again for dropping by.
