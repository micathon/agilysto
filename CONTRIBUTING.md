# Contributing to Aljebrist
* Many thanks for your interest in being a Aljebrist contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions in 2022
* If you wish to write detailed design specs or anything more ambitious, please contact me

# How to run Aljebrist
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`
* `$ java alj dotop > out.txt`
* text files:
  * `dat/dotop.alj`: sample Aljebrist source code
  * `bin/out.txt`: used for debugging and logging what my code is doing
  * both `dotop` and `out.txt` file names can be any valid Linux file name (or Windows/Mac)
