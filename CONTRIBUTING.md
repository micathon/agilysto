# Contributing to Fermotalk
* Many thanks for your interest in being a Fermotalk contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions probably not until 2024
* If you wish to write detailed design specs or anything more ambitious, please contact me
* At this point I don't have much documentation for coders, but feel free to email me with your questions for now
# How to run Fermotalk
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`
* `$ java fmtk atest > out.txt`
* text files:
  * `dat/atest.fmtk`: sample Fermotalk source code

  * both `atest` and `out.txt` file names can be any valid Linux file name (or Windows/Mac)
