# Contributing to Joopathon
* Many thanks for your interest in being a Joopathon contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions probably not until early 2024

# How to run Joopathon
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`
* `$ java joop atest > out.txt`
* text files:
  * `dat/atest.jp`: sample Joopathon source code
  * `bin/out.txt`: used for debugging and logging what my code is doing
  * both `atest` and `out.txt` file names can be any valid Linux file name (or Windows/Mac)
