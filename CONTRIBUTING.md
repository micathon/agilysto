# Contributing to Chatrithon
* Many thanks for your interest in being a Chatrithon contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions in late 2025 or maybe 2026
* Recruitment of contributors will commence after the console-mode version of the Chatrithon compiler is working
# How to run Chatrithon
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`
* `$ java chon atest > out.txt`
* text files:
  * `dat/atest.chon`: sample Chatrithon source code
  * `bin/out.txt`: used for debugging and logging what my code is doing
  * both `atest` and `out.txt` file names can be any valid Linux file name (or Windows/Mac)
