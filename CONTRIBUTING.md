# Contributing to Blugraze
* Many thanks for your interest in being a Blugraze contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions probably not until 2024
* If you wish to write detailed design specs or anything more ambitious, please contact me
* At this point I don't have much documentation for coders, but feel free to email me with your questions for now
# How to run Blugraze
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`
* `$ java blug atest > out.txt`
* text files:
  * `dat/atest.blug`: sample Blugraze source code

  * both `atest` and `out.txt` file names can be any valid Linux file name (or Windows/Mac)
