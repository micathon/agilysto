# Contributing to MoboLisp
* Many thanks for your interest in being a MoboLisp contributor
* I hope to begin accepting contributions in 2022
* If you wish to write detailed design specs or anything more ambitious, please contact me

# How to run MoboLisp
* Install the Java SDK
* `$ cd path/to/bin`

  * `dat/dotop.moob`: sample MoboLisp source code
