# Parithony
* Python-like scripting language, has Lisp/Java/Pascal qualities
* Sister language called JPML is like HTML, also used for config files
* In a nutshell, Parithony mimics the functionality of Python, minus several advanced features, plus a simpler syntax
* Only Lisp has a simpler syntax than Parithony, which is straightforward unlike Lisp and other oddball languages like SNOBOL and Forth
# Info for contributors
* For detailed info, see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) file, also if desired check out [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* Not quite ready yet to accept contributions (currently developing code execution of Parithony compiler)
* I work part-time in a perfume store. On January 31, 2024 I will quit my job so I can concentrate on Parithony development
* I hope to begin accepting contributions in 2025, if not sooner
