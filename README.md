# Jooperscript
* Python-like scripting language, has Lisp/Java/Pascal qualities
* Sister language called Joopertags is like HTML, also used for config files
* In a nutshell, Jooperscript mimics the functionality of Python, minus several advanced features, plus a simpler syntax
* Only Lisp has a simpler syntax than Jooperscript, which is straightforward unlike Lisp and other oddball languages like SNOBOL and Forth
# Info for contributors
* For detailed info, see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) file, also if desired check out [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* Not quite ready yet to accept contributions (currently developing code execution of Jooperscript compiler)
* I hope to begin accepting contributions probably not until early 2024
